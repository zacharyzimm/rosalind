Solutions to Rosalind Problems

Here's where I post the solutions that I come up with to various problems for rosalind, a bioinformatics problem-solving site (rosalind.info) I try not to use BioPython or other packages and solve it only with basic Python, writing out whatever I need from scratch. This is just for algorithm/OOP practice. In the future, I will be uploading solutions to a separate folder to rosalind's bioinformatics armory problems, which assume the use of advanced python packages
