Solutions to Rosalind Problems

Here's where I post the solutions that I come up with to various problems for rosalind, a bioinformatics problem-solving site (rosalind.info) I try not to use BioPython or other packages and solve it only with basic Python, writing out whatever I need from scratch. This is just for algorithm/OOP practice. In the future, I will be uploading solutions to a separate folder to rosalind's bioinformatics armory problems, which assume the use of advanced python packages


NOTE: All uploaded .py files contain the complete solution and can be run seperately with no dependencies, so there is going to be some overlap in code as the solutions in rosalind tend to build off of each other
